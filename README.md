## * Problems that we encountered
  During the project, we had to use the GitHub repository to push and pull our work. <br>
  Sometimes, when we were working on the same scene and trying to push it, we had merge conflicts, and because of that deleting one of the processes was unfortunately necessary. <br> 

  One of our modelers was completely new to using Blender and encountered the problems that come with having no experience. <br>
  Exporting Blender models didn't export the textures by default, making models that looked correct in Blender be completely gray in Unity. <br>
  The problem took a long time to identify, but was eventually fixed by changing the export settings in Blender and extracting the texture into the Unity Prefabs folder. <br>
